Synthetic Data Creation:

For the sake of this example, I generated some random weather data representing Pressure, Humidity, and WindSpeed. The temperature is modeled as a function of these features, plus some random noise for realism.
Linear Regression Model:

I used sklearn's LinearRegression to model the relationship between the features (Pressure, Humidity, WindSpeed) and the target (Temperature).
Training and Testing:

The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split. We train the model on the training set and test it on the testing set to evaluate the performance.
Model Evaluation:

I used Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate the model’s prediction accuracy.
Prediction:

After training, the model can be used to predict the temperature given new input features (e.g., Pressure, Humidity, and Wind Speed).
Visualization:

A scatter plot of actual vs. predicted temperatures is displayed to visualize the model's performance.
Example Output:

Mean Squared Error: 3.986
Root Mean Squared Error: 1.997

Predicted Temperature: 19.43°C
Visualization:
The scatter plot will show how close the predicted temperatures are to the actual temperatures. Ideally, points will be close to the diagonal line.

Notes:
Real Data: Instead of generating synthetic data, you could load a real dataset (e.g., from CSV, Excel, or any local file) containing historical weather data. You can use the pandas library to load and manipulate the dataset.
Model Complexity: This is a simple model using linear regression, which is just a starting point. Depending on the dataset, more advanced models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks can be used for better performance.
Where to Find Real Weather Datasets:
If you'd like to use real weather data, websites like Kaggle offer open datasets, such as:

Weather data from Kaggle
Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) data
This approach allows you to build a weather prediction model locally using datasets without the need for external API calls.
